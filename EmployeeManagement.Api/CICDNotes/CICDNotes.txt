Continuous Integration 
- we use build server to build the application and run regression tests (i.e. Unit Tests, Integration Tests)
Dontinuous Delivery
- we automatically deploy the application after the application is build and test runs successfully
GitHub Action
- A build system used for CICD  (or CI platform of GitHub)
- It automatically build the application and create executables (i.e. dll files in dotnet)

Publishing application using Visual Studio
- It is not recommended to do publishing from Visual Studio
- Because it is not:
	- reliable
	- repeatable
	- secure

Use CICD tools instead
- Because it reliable, repeatable and secure.

In Visual Studio Code
- There is a gitignore extension that automatically generate the gitignore contents
- Another option gitignore.io --> VisualStudio ->> Create
	- It generates all necessary gitignore commands for Visual Studio
- There is GitHub Actions extension that help writing the CICD commands in the yaml file

Steps are sequence of actions. Example
- Checkout -> actions/checkout@v3
- Setup dotnet -> actions/setup-dotnet@v3
